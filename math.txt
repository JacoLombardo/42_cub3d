MATH

FOV (Field of View): The total horizontal viewing angle of the camera
WIDTH: width of the screen (and of the projection plane) in pixel (or units)
HEIGHT: height of the screen (and of the projection plane) in pixel (or units)
GRID: grid size in pixel
M_PI: mathematical constant that represents the value of Ï€ (pi)
TAN: tangent of the angle
DIR_Y: y orientation of the ray
DIR_X: x orientation of the ray


Calculation of the distance of the player from the projection plane

DIS = (WIDTH / 2) / TAN(FOV / 2)



Incremental angle for ray casting (to be able to print one pixel per ray)

ANGLE = FOV / WIDTH



Starting angle for the first ray

ANGLE = 90 - (FOV / 2)



Measures of triangle (a is the angle of the ray in this case), the first formula is to obtain
the adjacent side (horizontal intersection), the second the opposite (vertical intersection)

TAN(a) = (GRID / 2) / Xa
Xa = (GRID / 2) / TAN(a)

TAN(a) = Ya / (GRID / 2)
Ya = (GRID / 2) * TAN(a)



Calculation of coordinates of a point (on the ray)

vertical:
A.y = (rounded_down(P.y) * GRID) + DIR_Y
A.x = P.x + ((P.y - (A.y / GRID)) / tan(ray_angle))



Calculation of the projection plane data

PLANE_SIZE = TAN(FOV / 2)

PLANE_X = PLAYER_DIR_X * PLANE_SIZE
PLANE_Y = -PLAYER_DIR_X * PLANE_SIZE
